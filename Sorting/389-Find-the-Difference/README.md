# 389. Find the Difference (Easy)

## 📝 Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t`. String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## 💡 Intuition & Approach
Since `t` is just `s` plus one extra character, the sum of all character values in `t` minus the sum of all character values in `s` will equal the value of the added character.

### 🛠️ The Strategy:
1. **Summation:** Convert the problem into a numeric one. Characters can be treated as integers.
2. **Calculate Sum(t):** Iterate through string `t` and add the ASCII value of each character to a `result` variable.
3. **Subtract Sum(s):** Iterate through string `s` and subtract the ASCII value of each character from the `result`.
4. **The Remainder:** The final value of `result` is the ASCII value of the extra character. Cast it back to `char` and return.



## 📊 Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** 𝙊(𝗻) - We traverse both strings once ($n$ being the length of $t$).
* **Space Complexity:** 𝙊(𝟭) - We only use a single integer variable to store the running sum.

## 💻 Implementation (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int result = 0;

        // Add character values from the longer string
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            result += c;
        }

        // Subtract character values from the original string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            result -= c;
        }

        // The remaining value is the ASCII of the added letter
        return (char) result;
    }
}
